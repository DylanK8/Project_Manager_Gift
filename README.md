# Project Manger Gift

This script ideally should be used for tracking, mapping and visualizing the progress of project-related work across different geographic locations and can be edited to suit your needs.

This Python script uses the Folium library to create an interactive map of the UK with markers based on geographical coordinates derived from postcodes. The data for the map is read from an Excel file ('yourfilename.xlsx') containing postcode and a date. The script iterates through the DataFrame created from the Excel file, attempts to obtain coordinates for each postcode using the geopy library, and adds markers to the map.

Markers are color-coded based on the date 'red' if the date is in the future, 'green' if it's in the past, and 'grey' if the date is not available (empty). The resulting map is saved as an HTML file named 'map.html'. The script includes error handling to manage potential issues during the processing of data and coordinates.
